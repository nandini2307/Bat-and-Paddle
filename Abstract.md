ABSTRACT

The Ball and Paddle project is concerned with a game in which the player attempts to bounce
and deflect the ball with a paddle. The paddle moves only in a horizontal way and will be
controlled by the player with the left and right arrows of the keyboard. There are three levels
involved in this game the speed of the ball increases as the level increments. The player will
lose if he fails to catch the ball with paddle three times. The score determines the level, as the
player reaches a certain score the level increments. The score, level and number of lives left
of the player will be displayed in the top left corner.
